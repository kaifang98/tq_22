##
A parent returns home for the evening and uses different smart devices to help the children with homework, turn on the oven, run the robot vacuum cleaner, and turn on the home security system for the night.

What allows the parent to perform all of these actions easily?   
`internet of things`

##
Edge computing is an extension of which technology?   

##
What does the Internet of Things (IoT) enable?   

##
What is a limitation of 5G mmWave, despite its high speed?
`shorter range`

##
What is a reason for users and businesses to adopt 5G networks?   
`Significant speed improvements in network technology that will enable new use cases and applications.`

##
What does the Internet of Things (IoT) enable?
`It allows everyday physical devices to exchange data.`

##
How does edge computing reduce latency for end users?   
`by migrating applications from one cloud provider to another`

##
A transit organization is looking to implement better experiences for customers.

What is a way the organization can utilize edge computing to help the organization achieve this goal?   
`Real-time data about train occupancy is captured and messaged on the platfor`

##
Why are 5G mmWave signals more likely to be blocked by physical barriers such as walls, buildings, and trees?   
`Its signals are transmitted at higher frequencies.`

##
A car's onboard navigation system receives a signal that an accident has occurred a short distance ahead, and alerts the driver while proposing an alternate route.

Which aspect of a 5G network helps in this situation?   
`reduced latency`

##
A large offshore oil platform needs to transmit signals between different devices on the platform with high reliability and low latency. However, they are unable to cover the platform with their existing Wi-Fi connections.

What is the best solution for the platform in this scenario?   
`building new 5G cell sites between the platform and the shore`

##
A global resources company uses data-intensive, cloud-based simulation software, but users in remote locations find that the responsiveness is poor due to the amount of data being transferred to and from the cloud. In response, the company decides to deploy multiple instances of the application in locations closer to the end users.

Which type of technology is illustrated in this example?   
`edge computing`

##
How does beamforming improve network service?   
`by using device locations to better target service signals`

##
If a person's mobile phone was designed to work with 4G technology, what will happen when a 5G network is rolled out in their area?
`They will still have service through the 4G network for at least several years.`

##
Why does it take so long for each generation of wireless communication technology to become broadly available?
`Devices that support a new generation are typically not available until years after the network is fully rolled out.`

##
A construction company is looking to improve safety and efficiency at its sites.

What is an example of a solution that requires the use of edge computing and the Internet of Things (IoT)?
