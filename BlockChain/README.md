What is a core domain for Accenture’s Multi-party Systems practice?
`digital identity`

##
An e-commerce company is collaborating with artisans from all over the world to sell the artisans' products. 
Accenture is helping this client build a platform that will maintain the integrity of the artisans' credentials 
by creating digital identities for them. 
This creates a privacy-preserving link between the products and the artisan's unique identities.

How will these digital identities help these artisans?
`by allowing them to interact with the e-commerce company and geting details of the buyer so they can target to a specific audience`

A software giant is enabling a city with smart parking, using real-time information captured by sensors on the vehicle and sensors in parking lots.
When the vehicle leaves, data can be shared between the vehicle and parking system, which will prompt a payment from the driver’s payment device stored in their account.

How would the use of blockchain to store this data help reduce potential risks?
